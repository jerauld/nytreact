# NYT React Search

**Overview**

New York Times React Search was created for the NYT React Search homework assignment for Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. New York Times React Search utilizes React components with helper/utility functions, as well as the React mounting lifecycle to query and dsiplay articles based on user searches. Node, Express and MongoDB are used so that users can save articles to read later.
